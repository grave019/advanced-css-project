### 1.Overview

Creating a portfolio page to showcase future projects.

### 2.Meeting Goals

Today more and more people are using phones or tablets to search the web. In order to keep up the new wave of handheld technology. Websites need to be written to showcase information on a smaller screen. With advanced CSS you can have optically pleasing pages that format the page to give the user a easier way to navigate the page. In my project I used pseudo elements and psuedo classes such as hover and first child to give my flex boxes a visually appealing style that animates the images. In addition, I arranged the flexboxes to appear different when viewing in a larger screen and the boxes are arranged in single collumn format to provide easier use for mobile users. All links in the page work and redirect you to other projects. Please note that there are placeholders on the page because the page will be updated in the future to showcase more projects.
